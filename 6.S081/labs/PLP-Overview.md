PLP 设立的大型塑料靶场的主要目的：

- acquisition of floating marine debris remote sensing data, using satellite and UAV platforms  in near-real environmental conditions
- production of an open-access image database for calibration and validation of floating  marine debris detection methodologies 
- extraction of meaningful spectral measurements (marine debris spectral library) in near-real  scenarios & compare the geospatial information ranging from moderate to very high  resolution
